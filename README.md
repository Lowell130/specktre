# Specktre

Specktre is a tool for generating low-contrast desktop wallpapers from tiling patterns.  Here are some examples of the sort of pattern it produces:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="output/demo_sq.png"> Squares</td>
    <td><img src="output/demo_tr.png"> Triangles</td>
    <td><img src="output/demo_hex.png"> Hexagons</td>
  </tr>
</table>

It can be used as a Python library, or invoked from the command-line.

## Installation

Clone this repository, or [download the ZIP][zip]:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:alexwlchan/specktre.git
```

You need to have Python installed (should work in 2.7 or 3.3+), then you need to install the two Python dependencies, which are [Pillow][pillow] and [docopt][docopt].
I recommend using a virtualenv:

```console
$ cd specktre
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There's also a Flask app you can use, if you prefer a graphical interface.
You need to install some extra dependencies:

```console
$ pip install -r flask_requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The file `specktre.py` is the main runner.  To see a help message:

```console
$ python specktre.py --help
```

The three demo images were generated as follows:

```console
$ python specktre.py --size=400x400 --start=178,26,16 --end=136,25,17 --squares --name='demo_sq.png'
Saved new wallpaper as demo_sq.png

$ python specktre.py --size=400x400 --start=255,204,0 --end=255,238,56 --triangles --name='demo_tr.png'
Saved new wallpaper as demo_tr.png

$ python specktre.py --size=400x400 --start=56,56,255 --end=0,0,194 --hexagons --name='demo_hex.png'
Saved new wallpaper as demo_hex.png
```

The `--start` and `--end` arguments indicate the colours that will be used to generate the pattern.
It's a tuple of R,G,B colours.
I recommend [HSL Picker][picker] as a free tool for finding RGB colour sets you like.

Alternatively, you can use the Flask app:

```console
$ python manage.py
```

and use it at <http://localhost:7007> in your browser.

The images are randomly generated, so each run will create a new pattern of colours.

## Whatâ€™s in the name?

The word "speckled" came to mind when describing this pattern, and I wrote the first version shortly after the James Bond film *SPECTRE* had been released.
